// Available        When a Connector becomes available for a new user (Operative) 
// Preparing        When a Connector becomes no longer available for a new user but no charging session is active.
//                  Typically a Connector is occupied when a user presents a tag, inserts a cable or a vehicle occupies the parking bay (Operative) 
// Charging         When the contactor of a Connector closes, allowing the vehicle to charge (Operative) 
// SuspendedEVSE    When the contactor of a Connector opens upon request of the EVSE, e.g. due to a smart charging restriction or
//                  as the result of StartTransaction.conf indicating that charging is not allowed (Operative) 
// SuspendedEV      When the EVSE is ready to deliver energy but contactor is open, e.g. the EV is not ready. 
// Finishing        When a charging session has stopped at a Connector, but the Connector is not yet available for a new user,
//                  e.g. the cable has not been removed or the vehicle has not left the parking bay (Operative) 
// Reserved         When a Connector becomes reserved as a result of a Reserve Now command (Operative) 
// Unavailable      When a Connector becomes unavailable as the result of a Change Availability command or an event upon
//                  which the Charge Point transitions to unavailable at its discretion. Upon receipt of a Change Availability command,
//                  the status MAY change immediately or the change MAY be scheduled. When scheduled, the Status Notification shall be send
//                  when the availability change becomes effective (Inoperative) 
// Faulted          When a Charge Point or connector has reported an error and is not available for energy delivery . (Inoperative).

// ConnectorLockFailure     Failure to lock or unlock connector. 
// EVCommunicationError     Communication failure with the vehicle, might be Mode 3 or other communication protocol problem.
//                          This is not a real error in the sense that the Charge Point doesnâ€™t need to go to the faulted state.
//                          Instead, it should go to the SuspendedEVSE state. 
// GroundFailure            Ground fault circuit interrupter has been activated. 
// HighTemperature          Temperature inside Charge Point is too high. 
// InternalError            Error in internal hard- or software component. 
// LocalListConflict        The authorization information received from the Central System is in conflict with the LocalAuthorizationList. 
// NoError                  No error to report. 
// OtherError               Other type of error. More information in vendorErrorCode. 
// OverCurrentFailure       Over current protection device has tripped. 
// OverVoltage              Voltage has risen above an acceptable level. 
// PowerMeterFailure        Failure to read power meter. 
// PowerSwitchFailure       Failure to control power switch. 
// ReaderFailure            Failure with idTag reader.
